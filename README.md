Let's say there's a sample problem. The input file is **T**, the number of test cases, followed by **T** lines. Each line in **N**, the number of values, followed by **N** ints. The output should be **T** lines, formatted "Case #*x*: *y*" where *x* is the test case, starting from 1, and *y* is the sum of the ints.

In plain python, this looks like:

```python
import sys

def tokens():
    for line in sys.stdin:
        for token in line.split():
            yield token
tokens = tokens()

num_cases = int(next(tokens))
for i in range(num_cases):
    num_values = next(tokens)
    values = [int(next(token)) for _ in range(num_values)]
    print("Case #{}: {}".format(i+1, sum(values)))
```

Quick, but the solution algorithm is mixed with input parsing and output formatting in an ugly way. LibCodeJam handles all that in a neat way:

```python
from code_jam import *

@autosolve
@collects
def solve(N: int,
          values: ('N', int)):
    return sum(values)
```

The `@autosolve` decorator sets up the solution function. It automatically sets up file parsing and output formatting. It reads the first token, **T**, and then calls your solver function **T** times, writing the return values. The `@collects` decorator sets up some magic token inputtingâ€“ it examines your function signature, and supplies your function with tokens or lists of tokens based on the annotations. This allows you to focus on just writing a function to solve the problem. The input file is read from stdin and the solution is written to stdout.

Some code jams have some global data, shared between test cases. `@autosolve` handles that as well, using the `@cases` nested solver helper. For instance, let's say there's a problem where the input is a line with the values **T** and **X**. On the following **T** lines is a single int **N**. The soltion to test case *n* is **N<sub>n</sub>** + **X**. Here's the LibCodeJam solution:

```python
from code_jam import *

@autosolve
@collects
def solve(T: int, X: int, tokens):
    @cases(T)
    @collects
    def solve_case(N: int):
        return N + X

    # The `yield from` indicates to @autosolve that this function solves a whole problem, not a single test case.
    yield from solve_case(tokens)
```
