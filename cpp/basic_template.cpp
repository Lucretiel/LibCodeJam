Your solution goes here. BASIC_SOLVE creates a function which solves a single
code jam case, which is invoked by AUTOSOLVE. The return type is deduced
automatically. The function is passed a Tokens object called tokens; see also
the macro interface for quick use of this object.

<vector>, <string>, <algorithm>, and <utility> are included.
using namespace std is in effect

Tokens macro interface:

NEXT(TYPE), GROUP(...), FILL(CONTAINER), MANY(N) [](){}
TOKEN(TYPE, NAME), MUT_TOKEN(TYPE, NAME), TOK_INT(NAME), TOK_STR(NAME)
TOK_CONTAINER(T, NAME, SIZE), TOK_VEC(T, NAME, SIZE), TOK_INTVEC(NAME, SIZE)
